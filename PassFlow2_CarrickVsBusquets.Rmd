Installation Instructions:
Please first make sure you are on version 3.6.2 or later of R before attempting to install
If not yet installed into R, run: install.packages("devtools")
Also run: install.packages("remotes") and then remotes::install_version("SDMTools", "1.1-221")
Then, install this R package as: devtools::install_github("statsbomb/StatsBombR")
Finally, library(StatsBombR)
This package depends on several other packages in order for all functions to run. Therefore, if you have problems with any functions or with installing the package, it is likely due to package dependencies.

Now, we perform the analysis on some top players that have similar style of play or play in the same position as Carrick and Busquets( central defensive midfielder). Some of them are  playing for top football clubs in Europe like Manchester City, Bayern Munich, PSG, Man United etc. Obviously, since we have a lot players, our criteria boils  down to the UEFA champions league qualifiers and the players'age. I want to analyse the players who are currently playing for some  of the clubs that are competing in the group stage of UEFA Champions league this year 2021/2022. Moreover, age is also the important factor. Football players' prime time is ranging from 18 to 29. That is exactly the criteria I want to filter out from the original data. 

The dataset I chose was called  "players.20.csv" 

The datasets are taken from this `https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/fifa-20-complete-player-dataset?select=players_20.csv`

PERFORM PCA (PRINCIPLE COMPONENTS ANALYSIS ON the new DATA)
 
 
Quick introduction of PCA:
It can be used as a dimensionality reduction method, which can help to minimize the number of the variables (or columns of a data frame) without losing much of the original information. This is useful especially when you are building machine learning models based on the data with many variables like 100s or 1000s.

But PCA can be also practically useful to visualize the relationships between the variables or even between the subjects of your interest such as customers, products, countries, etc.



```{r}
#first, we load the orginal data and filter out the stats for the players that we want to analyse

players_stats<-read.csv(file.choose(), header = T
             )
players_stats 




```



```{r}

cdm_players <-players_stats%>%
  filter(player_positions=="CDM",
         age %in%c(18:29),
         club %in% c("Juventus","FC Bayern MÃ¼nchen","Real Madrid","Liverpool","FC Barcelona","Paris Saint-Germain","Manchester City","	AtlÃ©tico Madrid","Chelsea","Borussia Dortmund","Inter","RB Leipzig","Sporting CP","Atalanta","Ajax","	FC Porto","Milan","SL Benfica","VfL Wolfsburg","Villarreal CF","Sevilla FC","Manchester United","Shakhtar Donetsk","LOSC Lille","Club Brugge KV")
         
         )



#take only numerical stats
cdm_players <- dplyr::select_if(cdm_players, is.numeric)
cdm_players <-cdm_players[, -c(1:15)]

cdm_players <-Filter(function(x)!all(is.na(x)), cdm_players)#remove NA values 
cdm_players
```


Now, I wonder if some of the measures can be very similar to one another. For example, if you are good at Sliding Tackle probably you might be also good at Standing Tackle.

So what are the variables that are highly correlated to one another?


1)Correlation — Pearson
One way to answer this question effectively is to run a correlation algorithm like Pearson.


```{r}
# calulate the correlations
r<-cor(cdm_players,use="complete.obs")
round(r,2)

#install.packages("ggcorrplot")
library(ggplot2)
library(ggcorrplot)
ggcorrplot(r)
```
In the Heatmap chart above, X and Y Axis have a same set of the measures and each intersection shows a colour that is ranging between Red and Blue. The darker the red is, the higher the positive correlation is between the two variables. The high correlation means that an increase in one variable can expect an increase in another variable in a linear fashion.

And, the darker the blue is the higher the negative correlation is. The high negative correlation means that an increase in one variable can expect a decrease in another variable.
If the colour is gray (between Red and Blue) then there is no correlation between the two variables.

Now, we would notice that there are two blue colour bands that are crossing. These are all Goal Keeper (GK) related measures such as:
GK Diving
GK Handling
GK Kicking
GK Positioning
GK Reflexes
And these are negatively correlated (Blue) to all the non-GK measures. So we can say that the players who score high on these measures tend to score low on the other type of measures, vice-a-versa. Goal Keepers and other position players are very different by looking at this data.
And the area where these Goal Keeper related measures intersect to one another shows dark red colour, which means that they are highly and positively correlated to one another.


```{r}
ggcorrplot(r, 
           hc.order = TRUE, 
           type = "lower",
           lab = TRUE)


```

PCA — Principal Component Analysis
This is when we want to try PCA.
PCA is an algorithm that generates a new set of artificial dimensions (components) that are created in a way that they are not correlated to one another and that carry as much information of the original data as possible with fewer dimensions.

As we saw with the correlation example above, there are many variables that are correlated to one another so probably we don’t really need to have the original variables. Instead, we might be able to express the same amount of the information with much fewer artificially created variables.
Let’s run PCA against the same data that consists of the same set of the football player skill measures.



```{r}
player.pr <- prcomp(cdm_players, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)
summary(player.pr)

player.pr

```

Since we standardised our data and we now have the corresponding eigenvalues of each PC we can actually use these to draw a boundary for us. Since an eigenvalues <1 would mean that the component actually explains less than a single explanatory variable we would like to discard those. If our data is well suited for PCA we should be able to discard these components while retaining at least 70–80% of cumulative variance. Lets plot and see:



```{r}
screeplot(player.pr, type = "l", npcs = 8, main = "Screeplot of the first 10 PCs")
abline(h = 1, col="red", lty=5)
legend("topright", legend=c("Eigenvalue = 1"),
       col=c("red"), lty=5, cex=0.6)

cumpro <- cumsum(player.pr$sdev^2 / sum(player.pr$sdev^2))
plot(cumpro[0:28], xlab = "PC #", ylab = "Amount of explained variance", main = "Cumulative variance plot")
abline(v = 4, col="blue", lty=5)
abline(h = 0.88682, col="blue", lty=5)
legend("topleft", legend=c("Cut-off @ PC4"),
       col=c("blue"), lty=5, cex=0.6)



```

```{r}
#use the following package to prevent the overlapped labels
#install_github("vqv/ggbiplot")
#install.packages("FactoMineR")
#install.packages("backports")


library(FactoMineR)
library(ggbiplot)
library(factoextra)
player.pr <-PCA(cdm_players,graph = FALSE)
fviz_pca_biplot(player.pr, repel = TRUE, select.var = list(contrib = 10))

```

As we can see, attacking passing and short passing are belonging to the first component since the arrows associated with these factors move towards to the higher ends of PC1. Whereas for PC2, Power Stamina is belonging to it.
TO see more which factors belong to which PC, we increase the number in the variable `contrib`: display only the n most influential vectors(n is what we chose)



We notice is that the first 4 components has an Eigenvalue >1 and explains almost 90% of variance, this is great! We can effectively reduce the dimension from 40 to 4 while only “loosing” about 10% of variance!
We also notice that we can actually explain more than 60% of variance with just the first two components. Let’s try plotting these:



```{r}

plot(player.pr$x[,1],player.pr$x[,2], xlab="PC1 (60.65%)", ylab = "PC2 (12.15%)", main = "PC1 / PC2 - plot")


```










```{r}



```






```{r}
```
